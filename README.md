# GLANN
A Artificial Neural Network running on GPU(GLSL) written in C++ in the Framework Qt

- The current IO is hardcoded in the void GLANN::paintGL() routine and just (tries to) map a sine function onto itself.

- Currentliy just 1/ONE Layer is supported and I get silly stripes while rendering the weights.
